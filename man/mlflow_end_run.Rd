}
\arguments{

\description{

}
\details{
The fluent API family of functions operate with an implied MLflow client
  determined by the service set by `mlflow_set_tracking_uri()`. For operations
  involving a run it adopts the current active run, or, if one does not exist,
  starts one through the implied service.
